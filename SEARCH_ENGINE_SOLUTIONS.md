# Search Engine Solutions Research & Implementation

## Current Status (2024)

### Problem
All major search engines now have sophisticated bot detection that blocks automated requests:
- **Google**: JavaScript challenges, CAPTCHA, IP blocking
- **Bing**: Redirects, user-agent blocking  
- **DuckDuckGo**: Status 202 redirects, block pages

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Playwright Search Engine ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**File**: `src/lib/playwrightSearch.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Working but may be blocked by advanced detection

**Features:**
- Headless browser automation
- JavaScript execution
- Realistic user behavior simulation
- Bot detection bypass attempts

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free (Playwright is open source)
- ✅ Handles JavaScript challenges
- ✅ Mimics real user behavior
- ✅ Bypasses most basic bot detection

**Cons:**
- ❌ Resource intensive
- ❌ Slower than direct HTTP requests
- ❌ Still can be detected by advanced systems
- ❌ May be blocked in production

**Cost**: FREE + Server resources

### 2. SerpAPI Search Engine ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**File**: `src/lib/serpApiSearch.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Ready (requires API key)

**Features:**
- Official Google search API
- Reliable and consistent results
- No bot detection issues
- Professional service

**Pros:**
- ✅ 100% reliable
- ✅ No bot detection
- ✅ Professional service
- ✅ Consistent results

**Cons:**
- ❌ Costs money ($50/month for 5,000 searches)
- ❌ Requires API key setup

**Cost**: $50/month for 5,000 searches

### 3. DuckDuckGo Search Engine ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**File**: `src/lib/duckDuckGoSearch.ts`
**Status**: ❌ Blocked by bot detection

**Features:**
- Free search service
- Less aggressive bot detection
- Simple HTTP requests

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Simple implementation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Blocked by bot detection
- ❌ Status 202 redirects
- ❌ Unreliable

**Cost**: FREE (but doesn't work)

### 4. Direct URL Construction ❌ REJECTED
**File**: `src/lib/uberEatsSearch.ts` (tryDirectUrl method)
**Status**: ❌ Rejected per user requirements

**Features:**
- Hardcoded URL patterns
- Direct UberEats URL testing

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fast and reliable
- ✅ No external dependencies

**Cons:**
- ❌ Limited to known restaurants
- ❌ Not scalable
- ❌ User explicitly rejected this approach

**Cost**: FREE

## Current Implementation Strategy

### Primary Search Flow:
1. **Playwright** (bypasses bot detection)
2. **SerpAPI** (reliable fallback)
3. **DuckDuckGo** (free fallback)

### Test Endpoints:
- `/api/test-playwright?restaurant=Name`
- `/api/test-serpapi?restaurant=Name`
- `/api/test-duckduckgo?restaurant=Name`
- `/api/test-search?restaurant=Name` (main endpoint)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: SerpAPI (Recommended for Production)
**Pros:**
- 100% reliable
- Professional service
- No bot detection issues

**Cons:**
- $50/month cost

**Implementation:**
1. Get SerpAPI key from https://serpapi.com
2. Add `SERPAPI_KEY=your_key` to `.env.local`
3. Test with `/api/test-serpapi?restaurant=Bao%20House`

### Option 2: Playwright + Proxy Rotation
**Pros:**
- Free (except proxy costs)
- Bypasses most bot detection

**Cons:**
- Complex setup
- May still be blocked
- Proxy costs ($50-200/month)

**Implementation:**
1. Add proxy rotation to Playwright
2. Implement residential proxies
3. Add more sophisticated bot detection bypass

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**Pros:**
- Multiple fallback options
- High reliability

**Cons:**
- Complex implementation
- Higher costs

**Implementation:**
1. Primary: SerpAPI
2. Fallback: Playwright with proxies
3. Emergency: Manual URL entry

## Cost Analysis

### SerpAPI Only
- **SerpAPI**: $50/month (5,000 searches)
- **Total**: $50/month

### Playwright + Proxy
- **Playwright**: Free
- **Proxy Service**: $50-200/month
- **Server Resources**: $20-50/month
- **Total**: $70-250/month

### Hybrid Approach
- **SerpAPI**: $50/month
- **Playwright + Proxy**: $70-250/month
- **Total**: $120-300/month

## Testing Results

### Current Test Results:
- **Playwright**: ❌ Blocked by Google
- **SerpAPI**: ⏳ Not tested (needs API key)
- **DuckDuckGo**: ❌ Blocked by bot detection
- **Direct URLs**: ✅ Working but rejected

## Recommendations

### For MVP (Phase 1):
1. **Start with SerpAPI** - Most reliable for production
2. **Keep Playwright as backup** - For development/testing
3. **Remove DuckDuckGo** - Not working reliably

### For Production (Phase 2):
1. **Primary**: SerpAPI for reliability
2. **Backup**: Playwright with advanced proxy rotation
3. **Monitoring**: Track success rates and costs

## Next Actions

1. **Get SerpAPI key** and test the implementation
2. **Remove direct URL approach** from main search flow
3. **Test Playwright with proxy rotation** if needed
4. **Implement monitoring** for search success rates
5. **Add error handling** for all search methods
