# Zestifyre PRD - Complete Development Guide
## AI-Generated Menu Images for UberEats Sales Boost

### **Product Overview**
Zestifyre is a web application that generates high-quality AI menu images for UberEats restaurants to boost their sales. This document serves as the complete development guideline with all phases and testing protocols.

### **Project Rules & Testing Protocol**
1. **Task Completion**: Each task must be completed and tested before moving to the next
2. **Testing Responsibility**: I will run tests for each completed task and provide you with testing instructions
3. **Progress Tracking**: Always reference this document to determine current project status
4. **Quality Gates**: No task is considered complete until testing is verified
5. **Documentation**: All completed tasks must be marked as "âœ… COMPLETED" in this document
6. **Repository Privacy**: All GitHub repositories should be private by default (by invitation only)
7. **Readability First**: Always prioritize text readability - ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors, especially for input fields and form elements
8. **Enter Key Functionality**: When creating input boxes, hitting Enter should perform the most logical next action. Consider: "nothing", "next field", "search", "submit". Examples: Search inputs should trigger search, form inputs should submit the form, multi-field forms should move to next field.
9. **Build Error Prevention**: Always run `npm run build` locally before pushing to GitHub to catch TypeScript/ESLint errors. Common issues: `any` types, unused variables, missing imports. Fix these immediately to prevent Vercel deployment failures.

### **Core Value Proposition**
- Generate professional-quality food images using AI
- Boost UberEats restaurant sales through better visual presentation
- Free sample image to demonstrate value
- Simple, frictionless user experience

## **Data Flow & Processing**

### **1. Restaurant Search Engine**
- **Input**: Restaurant name from form
- **Process**: 
  - Search UberEats for restaurant name using multiple engines
  - DuckDuckGo (primary), Playwright (fallback), SerpAPI (backup)
  - Return UberEats URLs for found restaurants
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Error Handling**: "Sorry, please try again later" message

### **2. Menu Data Scraping**
- **Input**: UberEats URLs from search engine
- **Process**: 
  - Extract menu items, descriptions, prices, images
  - Handle anti-scraping measures
  - Parse restaurant menu structure
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with different methods
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with partial data

### **3. Data Storage (Supabase)**
**Tables Structure:**
- **users**: email, restaurant_name, created_at, status
- **restaurants**: name, uber_eats_url, scraped_at, menu_items_count
- **menu_items**: restaurant_id, name, description, price, category, has_image
- **generated_images**: user_id, menu_item_id, image_url, status, created_at

### **4. Image Generation Priority**
- **Selection Criteria**: Most expensive OR most popular item
- **AI Prompt**: Combine food description + style reference from existing UberEats images
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with different prompts
- **Error Handling**: Daily email alerts to admin

### **5. Image Delivery**
- **Format**: High-resolution, UberEats-compliant specifications
- **Storage**: Cloud storage (AWS S3 or similar)
- **Download Link**: 30-day expiration
- **Email Content**: Download link + brief usage instructions

- **Triggers**:
  - UberEats search failures (after 3 retries)
  - Menu scraping failures (after 3 retries)
  - AI generation failures (after 3 retries)
  - Email delivery failures
  - Database connection issues

### **Email Alerts**
- **Recipients**: Admin team
- **Frequency**: Daily digest for generation failures
- **Content**: Error summary, affected users, recommended actions

### **User-Facing Error Messages**
- **Search Failure**: "Sorry, we couldn't find your restaurant. Please try again later."
- **Scraping Failure**: "Sorry, we couldn't load the menu. Please try again later."
- **Generation Failure**: "Sorry, we're experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later."
- **Generic Error**: "Something went wrong. Please try again."
